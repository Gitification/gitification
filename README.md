# gitification

A Gamification application allowing you to define custom badges your users can get depending on their actions.

You can customize the events you want to monitore and for each type of event you can associate a badge the users can get.

This application uses a Javascript stack and has been developed for the lesson OSF (OpenSource Frameworks) during our Master studies at HES-SO.


Our gamification platform is composed of four components, available as git submodules:
* *gitification-server* : the server components (REST API + database connections)
* *gitification-client* : the client front end to manage the users of the gamification application
* *gitification-javabench* : a Java client with benchmarks for our REST API
* *gitification-doc* : documentation of the project
